HIGHLIGHTS

- Immunity is modeled as dimensional surveillance, detecting dynamical collapse.
- Cancer and exhaustion represent phase transitions into low-dimensional attractors.
- Immune receptors act as synchronization probes measuring target cell complexity.
- Thermodynamic "friction" during low-D coupling drives T-cell exhaustion.
- scRNA-seq analysis confirms responders have 2x higher effective dimensionality.
