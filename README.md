## The Argument

The immune system is conventionally understood as pattern recognition: distinguishing "self" from "non-self" via molecular signatures. We propose something more fundamental: **immunity is dimensional surveillance**.

Cells embedded in functional tissue exhibit high effective dimensionality—complex, context-sensitive dynamics. Cells that have "defected" (cancer, viral infection, senescence) exhibit low dimensionality—they've collapsed into simpler attractors.

Immune receptors (CD molecules, TCR-MHC interactions) function as **synchronization probes**: they couple to target cells and measure dynamical complexity. Low-D cells get flagged for elimination.

This explains:
- **Cancer immune evasion**: Tumors fake high-D signatures via checkpoint molecules (dimensional camouflage)
- **Checkpoint blockade efficacy**: Removes camouflage, reveals true dimensionality
- **Autoimmunity**: Hypervigilant thresholds attack normal cells that transiently dip in dimensionality
- **Chronic inflammation + cancer**: Shallow attractors + raised thresholds = defectors slip through

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Dimensional surveillance** | Immune detection based on dynamical complexity, not molecular identity |
| **Attractor collapse** | Cancer/infection as escape from high-D tissue attractor to low-D replicative state |
| **Synchronization probes** | Immune receptors that couple to target cells and measure response complexity |
| **Inflammation** | Controlled destabilization—raising effective temperature to enable state transitions |
| **HPA threshold modulation** | Cortisol raises detection threshold (tolerate more deviation under stress) |
| **Fractal cooperation** | Same attractor-stabilization mechanism operates at cellular, organismal, and social scales |

## TODO

- [ ] Add simulation: immune cell coupling to high-D vs low-D target
- [ ] Find empirical data on tumor dimensionality vs immune infiltration
- [ ] Expand evolutionary section with phylogenetic evidence
- [ ] Add figures
- [ ] Get feedback from GPT/Gemini
